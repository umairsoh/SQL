SELECT
	f.title,
 interval '1' day * f.rental_duration,
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
-- Filter the query to exclude outstanding rentals
WHERE r.return_date is NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.title;


this will return two columns one that shows the expected days to have collapsed, vs the actual days that collapsed
