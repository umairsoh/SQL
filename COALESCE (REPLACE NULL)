LETS SAY you have null values and you would like to replace them. now think if you use partition over by how this function can be handy. 
use coalesce and specify

SELECT
  -- Replace the nulls in the columns with meaningful text
  COALESCE (Country, 'All countries') AS Country,
  COALESCE(Gender, 'All genders') AS Gender,
  COUNT(*) AS Awards
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Year = 2004
  AND Medal = 'Gold'
  AND Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'SWE')
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Country, Gender)
ORDER BY Country ASC, Gender ASC;
