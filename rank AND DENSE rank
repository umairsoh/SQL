-- here you can rank rows. the difference in using dense rank is that rows that have the same entry will join a ranking position .
--additionally you can partition your ranking by adding a partition by clause after over 

SELECT
  Country,
  -- Rank athletes in each country by the medals they've won
  athlete,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Country
                ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Rank_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, RANK_N ASC;
